1,2236,2284,2240,"they use the almost same memory, I assume that those three algorithms just need to use memory to store the array."
4,2240,2256,2268,"they use the almost same memory, I assume that those three algorithms just need to use memory to store the array."
22,2324,2300,2304,"This time they use more memory than previous case, is it because 22 is bigger?"
37,2232,2304,2312,same as above.
22906,2272,2224,2228,this time they use smaller memory. 
53757,2252,2248,2252,same as above.
112591,2228,2252,2232,same as above.
361940,2220,2228,2252,same as above.
475713,2280,2236,2240,same as above and the first two cases.
893766,2236,2284,2236,"It seems like whatever the cases are and the algorithm is, they all have almost same memory using."
996637,2228,2300,2248,"So I get a conclusion, the algorithms donâ€™t really need a lot of memory to do calculation or running, they just need to use memory to store array."
996639,2324,2240,2268,"same memory use, all three algorithm just need memory to store the array."
996652,2252,2252,2284,"same memory use, all three algorithm just need memory to store the array."
-996652,2332,2284,2252,"same memory use, all three algorithm just need memory to store the array."
